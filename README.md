# Data_Science_Competition
This competition was hosted by Wells Fargo Data Scientists in joint with UGA Data Science Department.


The objective of this project was to build models to review credit card applications and determine if they should be approved or denied. We were given historical data from credit card applications, already split into training, validation, and testing data sets.


Three .csv file represent our data sets, Data_Science_Competition.pdf is our report, Data Science Competition.pptx is our slide deck, and DataScienceComp.ipynb is our colaboratory python code.
